       <b>4)<u>EMOTION DETECTION SYSTEM</b></u> <br><br>The music choice of a user is not only dependent on historical preferences or music contents but also dependent
       on the mood of that user. In this paper, we present an effective music recommendation system, which
       recommends music based on the real-time mood of the user. It mainly focuses on Convolutional Neural
       Network (CNN) model which is based on Mobile Net architecture that classifies 7 different human facial
       emotions. Our system consists of three modules: Emotion Module, Music Classification Module and the
       Recommendation Module. The Emotion Module takes an image of the user's face as an input and makes use
       of CNN to identify their present mood. The Music Classification Module makes use of audio features to
       achieve a remarkable result of 98% while classifying songs into 4 different mood classes. <br>
